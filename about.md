# LetterBooksd 
## A Marvelous Mobile App for Finding Books, Sharing Thoughts, and Building Libraries!
### Created by Joshua Lee

## Team Joshua
I worked solo on this project, so all coding, API testing, and debugging was done by yours truly!

## Audience
   Our audience is anyone who loves reading books and would like to share their thoughts with the rest of the world! For people who not only want to find books to read, but recommend (or hate on) books to others! For people who want to curate special lists of the books they love, hate, or feel a certain way towards.

## Features
### Authentication
   In order to use LetterBooksd, one must make an account through an email and password or through Google account. All reviews, comments, and book collections are stored in Firebase in seperate collections and are associated with a user so that only the user can edit or delete those items.

### Find Books using Google Books API
   Our app contains a search functionality using Google Books API that allows users to find the book they are looking for by typing the title into the serch bar and our app will deliver a full list of results! Each result has an image of the book, information on the author and publisher, the page count, the date it was published, and even a short description of the book itself!

### Share Your Book Reviews
   Users can log on and leave reviews for books, including a rating and a text message on why you feel the way you do about a book. The best part: users can log on and comment under each review! Enjoy having slapfights and leaving several comments under a review! This type of interaction foster a sense of community in LetterBooksd's userbase.

### Create Unique Book Collections
   Users can create book collections containing the ids of all their favorite reads, either for themselves or to share with others! LetterBooksd is flexible, so users can even enter book titles or authors instead of simply book ids! A unique way to group up the books you love or hate!
